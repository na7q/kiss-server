# kiss-server
Use the revised.py script. It is the latest stable version!!

This script allows you to connect to any KISS TNC Modem like VARA with unlimited KISS clients, when the Modem usually only allows a single connection.
The sever acts as a man in the middle forwarding traffic bidirectionally between the clients and the modem.
